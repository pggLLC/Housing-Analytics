        <h2>Platform Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          The LIHTC Analytics Hub provides data-driven insights into how federal housing tax credits
          are allocated, priced, and deployed across states and metro regions. Our platform serves
          affordable housing developers, tax credit investors, housing finance agencies, and community
          development professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          We consolidate data from authoritative sources to help users understand policy variations,
          market conditions, and development opportunities in the affordable housing sector.

      <!-- Why LIHTC Matters -->
      <section class="content-section" aria-label="Why LIHTC matters">
        <h2>Why LIHTC Matters</h2>
        <p>
          The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program is the federal government's primary tool for
          encouraging private investment in affordable rental housing. Since 1986, LIHTC has financed
          approximately 3.6 million affordable rental units across all 50 states.
        </p>
        <p>
          While federally authorized, LIHTC operates through a state-level allocation system. Each
          state housing finance agency designs its own Qualified Allocation Plan (QAP), creating
          distinct development environments, risk profiles, and investment outcomes across regions.

      <!-- Methodology -->
      <section class="content-section" aria-label="Methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Data Aggregation:</strong> We collect data quarterly from authoritative sources
          and validate it against multiple references to ensure accuracy.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>State Allocations:</strong> Per-capita calculations use Census Bureau population
          estimates. Allocation tiers are based on total dollar amounts, not adjusted for cost of
          living or construction costs.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Market Analysis:</strong> Pricing data reflects secondary market transactions and
          may vary by deal structure, investor type, and state-specific factors.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Economic Indicators:</strong> Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) provides
          standardized metrics updated according to each series&rsquo; publication schedule.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Legislative Impact Modeling:</strong> Estimated cost savings based on analysis of
          H.R. 6644 provisions compared to current regulatory requirements. NEPA streamlining
          timeline reductions based on HUD environmental review data.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Commodity Forecasting:</strong> Forward projections combine futures market pricing,
          analyst consensus estimates, tariff policy assumptions, and supply-demand modeling.
