          Nine percent LIHTC pricing has dropped to <span class="highlight">$0.84</span> in Q1 2026, marking the lowest level in over three years as corporate tax appetite softens amid economic uncertainty and increased supply of credits.
        </p>

        <h2>Market Overview</h2>
        <p>The Low-Income Housing Tax Credit market has entered a significant correction phase, with 9% competitive credit pricing falling from $0.94 just one year ago to $0.84 today. This 10.6% decline represents the steepest year-over-year drop since the 2008 financial crisis and has profound implications for project feasibility, developer strategies, and affordable housing production nationwide.</p>
        <p>Four percent non-competitive credits have similarly declined to $0.79, down from $0.89 in early 2025. The parallel movement across both credit types suggests systemic market factors rather than program-specific dynamics.</p>

        <div class="callout">
          <h3>Key Findings</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>9% Credit Pricing:</strong> $0.84 (down 10.6% YoY)</li>
            <li><strong>4% Credit Pricing:</strong> $0.79 (down 11.2% YoY)</li>
            <li><strong>Transaction Volume:</strong> Down 23% from 2025</li>
            <li><strong>Developer Impact:</strong> 15–20% reduction in equity proceeds</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Primary Drivers of the Decline</h2>
        <h3>1. Corporate Tax Liability Reduction</h3>
        <p>The most significant factor driving pricing down is reduced corporate tax liability among traditional LIHTC investors. Several major banks and insurance companies have reported lower-than-expected profits in 2025, directly reducing their appetite for tax credits. Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase — collectively responsible for approximately 35% of LIHTC equity investments — have all reduced their 2026 acquisition targets by 15–25%.</p>

        <h3>2. Increased Credit Supply</h3>
        <p>State housing finance agencies allocated a record <span class="highlight">$12.8 billion</span> in tax credits during 2025, representing a 7% increase over 2024. This supply increase, coinciding with demand softening, has created an imbalance pushing prices downward.</p>

        <h3>3. Interest Rate Volatility</h3>
        <p>Persistent interest rate uncertainty has made long-term tax credit investments less attractive relative to other fixed-income alternatives. The 10-year Treasury yield has fluctuated between 3.8% and 4.6% over the past six months.</p>

        <h3>4. Economic Uncertainty</h3>
        <p>Broader macroeconomic concerns, including potential recession risks, trade tensions, and fiscal policy uncertainty, have made corporate investors more conservative in their multi-year investment commitments.</p>

        <h2>Regional Variations</h2>
        <p>While pricing has declined nationally, regional variations persist based on local market conditions, state policies, and investor concentration:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Northeast:</strong> $0.86 (relatively resilient due to strong regional bank presence)</li>
          <li><strong>West:</strong> $0.85 (California drives regional average)</li>
          <li><strong>South:</strong> $0.83 (largest allocation volume creates pricing pressure)</li>
          <li><strong>Midwest:</strong> $0.82 (weakest pricing reflects economic challenges)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Colorado specifically is pricing at $0.84, right at the national average, reflecting balanced supply-demand dynamics in the Denver metro area.</p>

        <h2>Impact on Development Feasibility</h2>
        <h3>Equity Gap Challenges</h3>
        <p>A typical 100-unit LIHTC development might receive a $2.5 million credit allocation. At $0.94 pricing (2025), this generated $2.35 million in equity. At current $0.84 pricing, the same allocation yields only $2.1 million — a $250,000 shortfall that must be filled with additional gap financing, increased debt, or reduced development scope.</p>

        <h3>Developer Responses</h3>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Value Engineering:</strong> Reducing per-unit construction costs by 8–12%</li>
          <li><strong>Additional Gap Financing:</strong> Seeking increased city, county, and state subsidy contributions</li>
          <li><strong>Basis Boost Maximization:</strong> Focusing on QCTs and DDAs for 30% basis boosts</li>
          <li><strong>Delayed Starts:</strong> Some projects placed on hold pending pricing recovery</li>
          <li><strong>4% Bond Deals:</strong> Shift toward 4% credits with tax-exempt bonds due to more predictable pricing</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="callout callout-info">
          <h3>Case Study: Denver Project Impact</h3>
          <p>A proposed 150-unit senior housing development in Denver received a $3.8 million credit allocation in the 2026 competitive round. At 2025 pricing ($0.94), this would have yielded $3.57 million in equity. At current pricing ($0.84), equity proceeds dropped to $3.19 million — a $380,000 gap addressed through increased city gap financing ($200k), reduced amenity scope ($100k), and developer fee reduction ($80k).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Looking Forward: Market Outlook</h2>
        <h3>Short-Term (Q2–Q4 2026)</h3>
        <p>We anticipate continued pricing pressure through mid-2026, with potential for further modest declines to the $0.82–$0.83 range for 9% credits.</p>

        <h3>Medium-Term (2027–2028)</h3>
        <p>We forecast gradual pricing recovery beginning in late 2026 or early 2027, driven by economic stabilization, supply-demand rebalancing, and investor diversification. Our econometric models suggest pricing will stabilize in the $0.85–$0.88 range by 2028, assuming moderate economic growth and no major policy disruptions.</p>

        <h2>Strategic Recommendations</h2>
        <h3>For Developers</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Maintain flexibility in project timelines to capitalize on potential pricing improvements</li>
          <li>Build deeper relationships with state and local gap financing sources</li>
          <li>Focus on sites that qualify for basis boosts and other enhancements</li>
          <li>Evaluate 4% bond deals as a potentially more stable alternative</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For Investors</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Current pricing presents potential value opportunities for investors with long-term tax appetite</li>
          <li>Focus on high-quality sponsors with track records of successful lease-up and operations</li>
          <li>Evaluate portfolio diversification across geographic markets and project types</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For State Agencies</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Monitor development pipeline closely for signs of significant slowdown</li>
          <li>Consider targeted QAP adjustments to maintain production levels</li>
          <li>Explore mechanisms to provide interim equity or gap financing support</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The current LIHTC pricing environment presents significant challenges but also opportunities. While $0.84 pricing complicates project feasibility, it also represents a potential entry point for new investors and could drive beneficial innovations in financing structures. We will continue monitoring pricing trends closely and will provide updated analysis as new data becomes available.
